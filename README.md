Added some css to the old version of the project.

Linked to a data base to save user details.

![database](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a54bdc-1bbe-4936-a5c8-6732ff4eca5b)

Improved the authentication by hashing the password saved in the database and also added Google OAuth.

![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58142b0b-2ae9-4152-8ca7-161bb97a897a)

On the first authentication, the user can see a secret which is some plain text. 

![initial secret page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d870853c-f4a9-4ee5-8f79-df8030b28f71)

User is able to submit their own secret.

![sumbit a secret page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ef86238-5ee5-4005-8d0e-bd05cc773bee)

After that the secret displayed for the user is their own, which is also saved in the database.
